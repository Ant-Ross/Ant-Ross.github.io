## Agent-Based Model
###_Hungry like the Wolf_

The model has the purpose of creating two different types of agents: **sheep** and **wolves**. Once created, the sheep will wander through an environment that contains "food". In addition to moving, they have two more functions: _eating_ and _sharing_ units with other sheep when they come close to a certain and predefined distance.

The wolves on the other have the capacity of moving through the environment and _hunting_ sheep when they step into a certain distance. In addition, the sheep increase their speed the more food they eat allowing them to escape from their predators. The model stops when all the sheep have been _hunted_ by the wolves.
