## Integrating data and simulation towards a mobility services decision support system
### _PhD research topic_

The rapid change in technology we are experiencing in cities across the world, and the associated rise of flexible travel modes (e.g. Mobility as a Service) are challenging the ways city authorities plan for the future. The models and data we use for this planning process haven't really changed for decades and involve a number of fixed assumptions and methods that mean the approach is increasingly less fit for purpose for looking at the impacts of trends in society such as homeworking and mobile technologies, or trends in city centre living and the future of the green belt.

The research aims at developing __tools for data analytics__ that combine the more conventional datasets used in land use and transport (LUT) planning (i.e. transport flows, ticket data, road network data, land use, land registry, socioeconomic data) with other datasets generated by the new set of sensors that support many of these urban systems, including traffic sensors, mobile and social media. These tools should include methods to deal with the inconsistencies observed between different datasets —namely spatial and temporal resolutions— and methods to generate new datasets for different modeling approaches used in LUT (from more traditional models to ABM and micro simulation). 

Finally, the research aims at developing __simulation models__ able to use the combined datasets and to process useful outputs. These models are expected to be used in policy design and evaluation. Both the input datasets and outputs generated by the models should be designed to be easily integrated in a common data infrastructure that facilitates the use of both data and models in common planning processes.
