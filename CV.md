## About me


**Masters in Transport Planning and the Environment**  
_The University of Leeds_ ● _Institute for Transport Studies_

In 2017 I graduated from the Transport Planning and the Environment master’s programme in the Institute for 
Transport Studies at Leeds. During my masters I studied topics related to emissions, pollution levels, street canyons and alternative modes of transport.
My dissertation research was entitled _Measuring Travel Time Reliability under Disruption Conditions for the London Underground_.
	
My main interests focus on sustainable transport, transport accessibility, spatial analysis and modal shift including active modes
of transport.
