## About me


**Masters in Transport Planning and the Environment**  
_The University of Leeds_ │ _Institute for Transport Studies_

In 2017 I graduated from the Transport Planning and the Environment master’s programme in the Institute for 
Transport Studies at Leeds. During my masters I studied topics related to emissions, pollution levels, street canyons and alternative modes of transport.
My dissertation research was entitled _Measuring Travel Time Reliability under Disruption Conditions for the London Underground_.
	
My main interests focus on sustainable transport, transport accessibility, spatial analysis and modal shift including active modes
of transport.

**Bachelors in Logistics and Supply Chain**
_Universidad del Caribe_

My final project was entitled _An optimization model for the location of biodecontamination equipment in the Mexican southeast_. A mathematical model was developed as a way of minimising the total transport costs from specialized equipment by the generation of customer clusters and optimal routes.


I have a background on Logistics and Supply Chain and worked for two years coordinating air and maritime international 
transport
